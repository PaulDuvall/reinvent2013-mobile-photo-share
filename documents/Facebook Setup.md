## Creating a Facebook Application

These instructions detail how to create a Facebook application that will enable web identity federation as part of the MobilePhotoShare sample app.

1.  Sign up for the Facebook developer program at [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com/)
2.  Visit the guide [Getting Started with the Facebook SDK for iOS](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/getting-started/facebook-sdk-for-ios/) and follow the instructions to **Create a Facebook App**. Make note of your `App ID`. You'll use it in configuring the sample. The other steps in this guide will be useful with your future Facebook Apps, but are not necessary for this sample.
